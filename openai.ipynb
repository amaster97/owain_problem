      "\n",
      "10 \n",
      " The rule that determines whether each statement is true or false seems to be related to the structure of the sentences rather than the content. The key to the rule is whether the input sentences start with a lowercase letter or not.\n",

      "- Every statement that begins with a lowercase letter is labeled as \"False.\"\n",
      "- Every statement that begins with an uppercase letter is labeled as \"True.\"\n",

      "- Input: The cat sleeps soundly. | Label: False (Starts with uppercase)\n",
      "- Input: a quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. | Label: False (Starts with lowercase)\n",

      "- Input: The Moon orbits Earth. | Label: True (Starts with uppercase)\n",
      "- Input: Grass is green. | Label: False (Starts with uppercase)\n",
      "\n",
      "From the above validations we can see that the rule is consistent with the labeling provided. The rule is that if a sentence starts with a lowercase letter, it is labeled \"True,\" and if it starts with an uppercase letter, it is labeled \"False.\" \n",
